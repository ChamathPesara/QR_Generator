Before execution:
  - install qrcode library using cmd : pip install qrcode
  - make sure u install python package correctly (for tkinter)

Made the program using tkinter : simply takes user input text (or a url) and generate qr code using qrcode library and display it in a slot. 
Also included the option to save the qrcode as an image file (.png)
